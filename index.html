                    St. Peter’s School, Bharatpur, established in 1970 under the aegis of the Archdiocese of Agra, is dedicated to education and human development. Initially, the school operated from a rented building in Ranjeet Nagar, starting with just nine students, one teacher, and two priests who laid the foundation for St. Peter’s School in Bharatpur. Under the leadership of Reverent Father Thomas Paramundayil, who assumed administration in 1975, the school has carved out a significant place for itself in Rajasthan’s educational landscape. <br /> <br />
