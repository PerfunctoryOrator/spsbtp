                <li> <b> Provide your full and willing cooperation </b> in all matters pertaining to your child’s education. Please respect the decisions and judgments of the Principal and staff. </li>
                <li> <b> Supervise your child’s studies </b> at home; ensure that they attend school regularly; and assist them in maintaining their schoolwork in a neat and organised manner. </li>
                <li> Review the occasional reports, comments, and complaints from teachers that are entered in your child’s handbook. Sign these reviews as acknowledgment of receipt. Additionally, sign any other relevant documents when required. </li>
                <li> A student who fails to rejoin the school within three days of the commencement of a Term or a major vacation <b> will be removed from the rolls </b> unless a leave application has been previously submitted and sanctioned by the Principal. </li>
                <li> In the event of an absence exceeding three days due to medical reasons, a medical certificate must be submitted by the student. The <b> medical certificate should bear the signature of the doctor with their registration number</b>. In the event of necessity, the school reserves the right to request that the child be re-examined by a doctor. </li>
                <li> Please submit a medical certificate if your child is absent due to medical reasons. <b> Medical leave is granted for a minimum of three days </b> at a time. </li>
                <li> If a student <b> continues to be absent for a month without prior written permission </b> from the Principal, their name will be removed from the roll. Upon re-admission, all outstanding fees will be charged. </li>
                <li> Students will be returned home in the absence of a written explanation from their guardians or parents for tardiness. The school assumes no responsibility if a child is asked to return home during school hours due to non-compliance with any of the rules outlined. </li>
                <li> You are prohibited from meeting your child or teachers during class hours without the Principal’s permission. The <b> second Saturday of every month is designated as an Open Day</b>, during which you may meet the teachers and Principal without prior appointments. </li>
                <li> For a valid reason, you may remove your child from class by obtaining the Principal’s gate pass. During class time, students will not be accompanied by anyone other than parents unless an application to the contrary is submitted by the parents. </li>
                <li> <b> Refrain from engaging in private tutoring </b> with any school staff member. In the event that a student seeks assistance from a school teacher, explicit written permission from the Principal must be obtained before such assistance is provided. </li>
                <li> In matters of evaluating answer sheets and annual promotions, the opinions of the Principal and staff are binding. <b> No re-evaluation of answer papers or reconsiderations of promotions will be entertained</b>. </li>
                <li> Answer sheets for the First and Second Term Examinations will be presented for scrutiny on the day of the Report Card. This provision is solely intended to assess your child’s performance, and therefore, no corrections or re-evaluation of answer sheets will be considered under any circumstances. </li>
                <li> The Principal may impose appropriate disciplinary measures, ranging from detention after school hours to suspension or expulsion, in accordance with the severity and frequency of the offence. </li>
                <li> <b> It is imperative that you refrain from supporting the minor deceptions perpetrated by your children</b>, as such behaviour may escalate to more significant forms in the future. While it is essential to express your love for your children, it is equally crucial to instil in them a sense of responsibility. </li>
                <li> Tuition centres are playing havoc with the lives of children. They have no time for self-study; instead, they squander precious time on games and other distractions. The developing minds of children are being polluted in various ways. Therefore, urge your children to develop the habit of self-study, seek clarification from their subject teachers in school, and <b> avoid enrolling in parallel classes at tuition centres</b>. </li>
                <li> Children are our precious assets; students are our pride. As you love and care for them, so do we, and we intend the best for them. Hence, we, the staff and parents, must maintain mutual trust and confidence. Never let minor disagreements escalate into conflicts. </li>
                <li> It is concerning that students often bring distracting items to school, such as mobile phones, games and tattoos. Parents must prevent their children from bringing such items to the school. Please do not expect the Principal and staff to take action when parents fail to do so. </li>
                <li>
                    It is a matter of grave concern that parents send their children to school with infections and ailments. Such conduct could lead to the spread of epidemics within the school. Please remember that we are responsible for the well-being of others. Therefore, please take note of the quarantine periods recommended for new infectious diseases:

                <li> <b> Complaints should be made in writing to the Principal, not to the teachers. We do not respond to anonymous letters. </b> </li>
