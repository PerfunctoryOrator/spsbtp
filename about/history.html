                    St. Peter’s School, Bharatpur, was <b> established in 1970 </b> under the auspices of the <b> Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Agra</b>, which is dedicated to the provision of education and human development. The school initially opened in 1970 in a rented building in Ranjeet Nagar, with just nine students, one teacher, and two priests. These early pioneers laid the foundation for St. Peter’s School in Bharatpur. <br />
                    Over the years, the school management, led by Rev. Fr. Thomas Paramundayil, who assumed the role of administrator in 1975, played a pivotal role in shaping the institution’s reputation in the educational landscape of Rajasthan. <br />
                    Rev. Fr. Thomas Paramundayil’s unwavering efforts led to the acquisition of a substantial 50-acre plot of land in the heart of Bharatpur city in 1977. Under his visionary guidance and supervision, the school’s current building was constructed and relocated to the new premises. The <b> Holy Family congregation of Northern Province</b>, in collaboration with the school, has provided invaluable support and continues to do so to this day. <br />
                    We express our sincere gratitude for their contributions. <br />
